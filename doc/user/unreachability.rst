Unreachability Information SAFI
================================

.. _overview-unreachability:

Overview
--------

BGP Unreachability Information SAFI provides a mechanism to propagate prefix
unreachability information through BGP without affecting the installation or
removal of routes in the Routing Information Base (RIB) or Forwarding Information
Base (FIB). This creates a parallel information plane for sharing unreachability
data for monitoring, debugging, and coordination purposes.

The implementation is based on the IETF draft:
`draft-tantsura-idr-unreachability-safi <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tantsura-idr-unreachability-safi/>`_

Key characteristics:

- Maintains a separate Unreachability Information RIB (UI-RIB)
- Does NOT install routes in Loc-RIB or affect forwarding
- Uses standard BGP path selection for UI-RIB entries
- Supports IPv4 (AFI=1) and IPv6 (AFI=2) address families
- Uses SAFI=TBD1 (draft specification), implemented with private SAFI 254

.. _design-principles-unreachability:

Design Principles
-----------------

FRR implements the core Unreachability Information SAFI functionality:

**NLRI Structure**

The NLRI is uniquely identified by the combination of Prefix Length and Prefix.
Reporter TLVs are NOT part of the NLRI key but provide information about each
reporting speaker.

Each Unreachability NLRI contains:

- Prefix (IPv4 or IPv6)
- Reporter TLV containing:

  - Reporter Identifier (BGP Router-ID of the reporting speaker)
  - Reporter AS Number (4-octet AS number of the reporting speaker)
  - Sub-TLVs (one or more):

    - **Sub-TLV Type 1: Reason Code** (2 octets) - Indicates why the prefix
      is unreachable

      - 0: Unspecified
      - 1: Policy Blocked
      - 2: Security Filtered
      - 3: RPKI Invalid
      - 4: No Export Policy
      - 5: Martian Address
      - 6: Bogon Prefix
      - 7: Route Dampening
      - 8: Local Administrative Action
      - 9: Local Link Down
      - 10-64535: Reserved
      - 64536-65535: Reserved for Private Use

    - **Sub-TLV Type 2: Timestamp** (8 octets) - Unix timestamp (seconds since
      epoch) in network byte order, indicates when the unreachability event
      occurred or was detected by this reporter

**Next Hop Handling**

For Unreachability SAFI, the Next Hop Length in MP_REACH_NLRI is set to 0, as
this information is purely for monitoring and does not affect forwarding decisions.

**Implementation Scope**

The current implementation includes:

- Single Reporter TLV per NLRI (no aggregation)
- Capability negotiation via AFI/SAFI
- Standard BGP path attributes (AS_PATH, ORIGIN, etc.)
- Graceful Restart support
- Show commands with detailed reporting information

**Not Implemented:**

- Multiple Reporter TLV aggregation
- Individual reporter withdrawal
- Enhanced capability with aggregation (A) bit

.. _configuration-guide-unreachability:

Configuration Guide
-------------------

Basic Address Family Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable Unreachability Information SAFI with a neighbor:

.. code-block:: frr

   router bgp 65001
     neighbor 192.0.2.1 remote-as 65002
     !
     address-family ipv4 unreachability
      neighbor 192.0.2.1 activate
     exit-address-family
     !
     address-family ipv6 unreachability
      neighbor 2001:db8::1 activate
     exit-address-family
   exit

Advertisement Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. clicmd:: bgp advertise-unreach interfaces-match PREFIX

   Control which local interface addresses trigger UNREACH NLRI advertisement.
   Only self-originated UNREACH routes for interfaces matching PREFIX will be
   created and advertised to peers.

   When an interface with a matching address goes down, an UNREACH route is
   created and advertised. When it comes back up, the route is withdrawn and
   deleted. Non-matching interfaces do not generate UNREACH routes.

   UNREACH routes received from peers are forwarded normally (standard BGP
   transit) regardless of this configuration.

   .. code-block:: frr

      router bgp 64600
        address-family ipv6 unreachability
         neighbor 2001:db8:100::1 activate
         bgp advertise-unreach interfaces-match 2001:db8:1::/48
        exit-address-family

.. _operational-aspects-unreachability:

Operational Aspects
-------------------

Capability Negotiation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unreachability Information SAFI is negotiated like any other AFI/SAFI using
the Multiprotocol Extensions capability (RFC 5492). The capability exchange
includes:

- AFI: 1 (IPv4) or 2 (IPv6)
- SAFI: TBD1 (draft specification)
- Implementation uses private SAFI 254 pending IANA allocation

Both peers must negotiate the capability before exchanging unreachability NLRIs.

Graceful Restart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Graceful Restart (RFC 4724) is supported for Unreachability SAFI:

- Forwarding State (F) bit is set to 0 (no forwarding state to preserve)
- Stale marking applies during peer restart
- End-of-RIB marker signals completion of re-advertisement
- Stale entries are removed after End-of-RIB or timeout

Path Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Standard BGP path selection applies to UI-RIB entries:

- Considers Weight, Local Preference, AS_PATH length, ORIGIN, MED, etc.
- Reporter TLV content does NOT influence path selection
- Maximum paths is hardcoded to 1 (single best path)

Route Filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Standard BGP filtering mechanisms apply:

- Route-maps for import/export policies
- Prefix-lists for prefix filtering
- Community matching for policy control
- AS-path filtering

**Example with route-map:**

.. code-block:: frr

   router bgp 65001
     neighbor 198.51.100.1 remote-as 65002
     !
     address-family ipv4 unreachability
      neighbor 198.51.100.1 activate
      neighbor 198.51.100.1 route-map UNREACH-IN in
      neighbor 198.51.100.1 route-map UNREACH-OUT out
     exit-address-family
   !
   route-map UNREACH-IN permit 10
     set local-preference 50
   !
   route-map UNREACH-OUT permit 10
     match community NO-EXPORT-UNREACH
   !

.. _limitations-unreachability:

Limitations / Known Issues
--------------------------

**Not Implemented:**

- **Multiple Reporter TLV Aggregation**: The current implementation supports
  only a single Reporter TLV per NLRI. The draft's aggregation mechanism for
  combining multiple reporters into one NLRI is not implemented.

- **Individual Reporter Withdrawal**: Cannot selectively withdraw individual
  reporters from an aggregated NLRI (since aggregation is not implemented).

- **Enhanced Capability**: The aggregation (A) bit in the enhanced capability
  is not implemented.

- **ADD-PATH**: ADD-PATH extension for unreachability SAFI is not supported.

**Operational Limits:**

- Maximum paths is hardcoded to 1 (no multipath for unreachability)
- UI-RIB size should be monitored to prevent memory exhaustion
- Rate limiting on unreachability updates is recommended

.. _debugging-unreachability:

Debugging & Troubleshooting
----------------------------

.. clicmd:: debug bgp updates

   Enable debugging of BGP update messages, including unreachability NLRIs.

.. clicmd:: debug bgp zebra

   Enable debugging of Zebra integration for unreachability SAFI, including
   interface state changes.

**Monitoring UI-RIB:**

You can verify unreachability information is being processed correctly:

.. code-block:: frr

   router# show bgp ipv4 unreachability
   router# show bgp ipv6 unreachability detail
   router# show bgp interface detail

**Logs:**

Unreachability events are logged via syslog when:

- Interface state changes occur
- Test commands are executed
- Unreachability NLRIs are received from peers

.. _security-considerations-unreachability:

Security Considerations
-----------------------

**Deployment Recommendations:**

- Enable unreachability SAFI only with trusted peers
- Use BGP TCP-AO (RFC 5925) or MD5 authentication for session protection
- Implement prefix filtering using route-maps
- Monitor UI-RIB size and growth patterns
- Configure maximum-prefix limits for unreachability address-family
- Consider information leakage implications (reveals network topology)

**Potential Risks:**

- **State Exhaustion**: Malicious peers could advertise excessive unreachable
  prefixes. Use maximum-prefix limits.

- **False Information**: Peers could advertise incorrect unreachability data.
  This does not affect routing but may impact monitoring systems.

- **Information Disclosure**: Unreachability reports reveal internal network
  state. Use careful peering policies.

.. _use-cases-unreachability:

Use Cases
---------

**Inter-AS Debugging**

Share unreachability information between cooperating ASes for troubleshooting
without affecting production traffic:

.. code-block:: frr

   router bgp 65001
     neighbor 198.51.100.1 remote-as 65002
     neighbor 198.51.100.1 description "Peer for debugging"
     !
     address-family ipv4 unreachability
      neighbor 198.51.100.1 activate
      neighbor 198.51.100.1 maximum-prefix 10000
     exit-address-family

**Route Collector Integration**

Deploy on route collector sessions for enhanced telemetry:

.. code-block:: frr

   router bgp 65001
     neighbor 203.0.113.1 remote-as 65001
     neighbor 203.0.113.1 description "Route Collector"
     !
     address-family ipv4 unreachability
      neighbor 203.0.113.1 activate
     exit-address-family
     !
     address-family ipv6 unreachability
      neighbor 203.0.113.1 activate
     exit-address-family

**DDoS Target Coordination**

Share attack target information across network boundaries without null-routing:

.. code-block:: frr

   router bgp 65001
     neighbor 198.51.100.1 remote-as 65002
     !
     address-family ipv4 unreachability
      neighbor 198.51.100.1 activate
      neighbor 198.51.100.1 route-map DDOS-TARGETS-OUT out
     exit-address-family
   !
   route-map DDOS-TARGETS-OUT permit 10
     match community DDOS-TARGET
   !
